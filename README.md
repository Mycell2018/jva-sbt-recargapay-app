  -d postgres:13
```

### 3. Configure `application.yml`

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/recargapay_db
    username: admin
    password: o49CJ645xMl15nsSgeV7c9Lm

  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    properties:
      hibernate:
        format_sql: true
        use_sql_comments: true
        dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
    show-sql: true

  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: https://sso.3fautomacao.com.br/realms/master
```

## üîê Security & Authentication

This service uses **Spring Security** integrated with **Keycloak** for OAuth2-based access control.

To obtain an access token:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://sso.3fautomacao.com.br/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data grant_type=password \
  --data username=api \
  --data password=1234 \
  --data client_id=account
```

Include the token in every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

---

## üìã Auditing

This service uses **Hibernate Envers** to log and trace changes to all transactional and user data.  
You can view audit logs through the `/api/v1/audit` endpoints, as documented in Swagger.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## üß™ Running Tests

To run all unit and integration tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

## üß† Design Decisions

The Wallet Service was designed following the principles of modularity, traceability, and reliability.

- Each core function (create wallet, deposit, withdraw, transfer) is encapsulated in its own service with proper domain boundaries.
- Hibernate Envers is used to ensure full auditability of financial and user-related actions.
- Spring Security and OAuth2 integration with Keycloak guarantees token-based access control, enabling secure communication with minimal overhead.
- PostgreSQL was selected due to its strong ACID compliance and support for concurrent transactions.
- All endpoints are idempotent where applicable, and transactional integrity is guaranteed via `@Transactional` boundaries in service layers.

This design ensures that the service fully satisfies:
- Functional requirements for balance management and fund movement.
- Non-functional requirements such as availability, consistency, and traceability.

## ‚è≥ Trade-offs & Time-Based Compromises

Given the 6‚Äì8 hour scope constraint, the following compromises were made:

- The system currently supports one wallet per user. Multi-wallet support could be implemented later via an extra mapping table or multi-tenancy layer.
- Some validations are handled at the service level and not yet enforced through a centralized validation mechanism.
- The deployment strategy was not containerized (e.g., via Docker Compose), although the system is compatible with such an approach.
- Integration with external services (notifications, fraud prevention) was excluded to keep the scope focused and manageable.

These trade-offs were carefully chosen to maintain a working and testable service that delivers on all core features while remaining easy to extend.
